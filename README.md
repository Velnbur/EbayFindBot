# EbayBot
## What it actually does?
This is my own small project for my chanel in Telegram. I made it to automate the parsing products from such sites as Ebay and AliExpress, but now it works fine only with Ebay FInding API.
## Getting started
Its very easy. You can just find it in Telegram by the name "ali-music-bot" and add it to the chat you want, but by default it finds only guitar kind products. If you want to change that - find "&keywords=guitar&", replace "guitar" with the another keyword, compile and do with it what you want.
